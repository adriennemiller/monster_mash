# Monster Mash
-------------
Created by Brian Pak and Adrienne Miller 

Final project for Flatiron School, Module 2.

This app allows users to create an account and create their own monsters by mix and matching different heads/torsos/legs and customizing the size and color. Monsters can be entered into a beauty contest and voted on until the admin ends the contest. Users can also like other users' monsters. 

This app was created with Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/).
